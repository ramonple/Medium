T-Test, ANOVA, Chi-Squared Test with Examples




4 Steps in Hypothesis Testing

---- Step 1: Define null and althernative hypothesis


---- Step 2: Choose the appropriate statistic test

T-test: compare two groups/categories of numeric variables with small sample size

ANOVA test: compare the difference between two or more groups/categories of numeric variables

Chi-Squared test: examine the relationship between two categorical variables

Correlation test: examine the relationship between two numeric variables



---- Step 3: Calculate the p-value


---- Step 4: Determine the statistical significance

T-test
T-test is used when we want to test the relationship between a numeric variable and a categorical variable.
There are three main types of t-test.

1. one sample t-test: test the mean of one group against a constant value
2. two sample t-test: test the difference of means between two groups
3. paired sample t-test: test the difference of means between two measurements of the same subject

t_stat,pvalue = ttest_ind(recency_P,recency_N)

ANOVA test
ANOVA stands for analysis of variance. It is used to compare the mean between several groups.

ANOVA examines the difference among groups by calculating the ratio of variance across groups vs variance within a group.

degree of freedom, total sample (n) and the number of groups (k)
n-k

The only difference between one-way and two-way ANOVA is the number of independent variables. 
A one-way ANOVA has one independent variable, while a two-way ANOVA has two.


The One-way ANOVA is extension of independent samples t test. 
In independent samples t test used to compare the means between two independent groups, 
whereas in one-way ANOVA, means are compared among three or more independent groups).


sns.boxplot()
stats.f_oneway()


calculate the p-value:

x = np.linspace(rv.ppf(0.0001), rv.ppf(0.9999), 100000)
y = rv.pdf(x)
pvalue = 1 - rv.cdf(x)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chi-Squred Test
Chi-Squared test is for testing the relationship between two categorical variables.

sns.sns.barplot()
stats.chi2_contingency()


calculate the p-value: p value is calculated as the right tail cumulative area: 
1-rv.cdf(chi2_statistics)
